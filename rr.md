Primary Color: Deep Navy Blue (#1a1f36) – evokes professionalism and trust.
Secondary Color: Bright Accent like Electric Blue (#3a86ff) or a Vibrant Teal (#00bfa6) – adds modernity and liveliness.
Neutral Backgrounds: Light Gray (#f5f5f5) or White (#ffffff) for clean, minimal layouts.
Text Color: Dark Gray or Black (#333333) – for clear readability.
Example Color Scheme:
Background: White or Light Gray (#f5f5f5)
Primary: Deep Navy Blue (#1a1f36)
Accent: Teal (#00bfa6) for buttons, highlights
Text: Black (#333333)
This combination of a neutral background with a bold primary color and vibrant accent will make the design feel modern yet professional.
